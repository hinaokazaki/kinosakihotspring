			<h2>Findability Vocabulary</h2>
			<section class="voca1">
				<h4>SEO</h4>
				<p>SEO means Search Engine Optimization and is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration, content relevance and link popularity so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>404 error page</h4>
				<p>A 404 error page is a web page designated to be displayed when a request triggers the HTTP 404 response code. This code means the client (or, “visitor”) was able to locate the server, but not the specific destination. In other words, they found your site, but not a specific page within your site.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Black Hat</h4>
				<p>Black hat hackers are malicious hackers, sometimes called crackers. Black hats lack ethics, sometimes violate laws, and break into computer systems with malicious intent, and they may violate the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an organization's systems and data.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>White Hat</h4>
				<p>the good guy who uses his (or her) capabilities to damage your organization — but only hypothetically. Instead, the real purpose is to uncover security failings in your system in order to help you safeguard your business from the dangerous hackers. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Site map</h4>
				<p>A sitemap is a planning tool that presents a list of website pages, typically organized in a hierarchical fashion, that are accessible to users. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Website Friendly</h4>
				<p>Findability is the ease with which information contained on a website can be found, both from outside the website and by users already on the website.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Accessibility</h4>
				<p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Content marketing</h4>
				<p>It is the part of inbound marketing that companies use to create a lot of interesting content on the internet which helps spread a positive image of their brands.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Keyword</h4>
				<p>Keywords are ideas and topics that define what your content is about. In terms of SEO, they're the words and phrases that searchers enter into search engines, also called "search queries." If you boil everything on your page — all the images, video, copy, etc.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="voca">
				<h4>Search engine</h4>
				<p>A search engine is a web-based tool that enables users to locate information on the World Wide Web. Popular examples of search engines are Google, Yahoo!, and MSN Search.</p>
